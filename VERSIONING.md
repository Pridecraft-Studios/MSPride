# PridePack Versioning
The versioning shall consist of three elements:
- Major Version `M.u.f`
- Update Version `m.U.f`
- Fix Version `m.u.F`

With `major` being bumped in relation to Minecraft's major release, and the other ones following [`semver`](https://semver.org)

For example, in 1.21, the first release is 6.0.0. If we had released a version for 1.20.6, the next version would be 5.2.
